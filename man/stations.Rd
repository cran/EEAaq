\description{
This dataset belongs to the European Environment Agency. Assessment methods meta-data (data set D) describe technical facilities used for the measurement
of one pollutant or one of its compounds. It contains information about the measurement stations mapped by the EEA
in Europe. This dataset may be out of date, and for this reason the use of the \code{\link{EEAaq_get_stations}} function
is suggested.
